   <h2>Edigho</h2>
   <p>My name is Inuwere kingsley Okemena, i live in lagos,Nigeria. i have a national diploma in accounting,<br>
     but i have a knack for the internet and technological innovation at large, so i decided to switch carreer<br>
     in tech space. i lost my parent at an early age, so basically, i am in charge of my life.</p>
    <p>I am single at the moment and hoping to mingle, i love soulful music,mma,football and i also love cooking.<br>
     Venturing into tech, gives me the opportunity of working remotely and that will eventually give me enough time<br>
     to spend with my potential family, i pray that i continue with this tenacity and see it through to the end.
